### Machine Learning for Predicting Cardiovascular Diseases  
**Authors:** Paula Quintanilla, David Flores, Iñaki Muñoz 

**Project Description:**  
This project focuses on the application of Machine Learning techniques to a medical dataset to predict the probability of a patient having cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, with a substantial impact on public health. The goal is to develop an accurate model to identify patients with a high or low likelihood of cardiovascular disease, enabling early intervention and prevention.  

The dataset used is anonymized and sourced from public health records. It contains 19 predictive variables related to the demographic and medical status of patients, along with a response variable indicating whether the patient has been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.  

The project is structured into two main phases:  

**Phase 1: Model Development**  
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Implementation of techniques to address imbalanced datasets (e.g., SMOTE).  
- Application and comparison of predictive algorithms.  

**Phase 2: Model Refinement and Evaluation**  
- Optimization of model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.  
- Identification of the most critical predictive variables.  
- Selection of the best-performing model.  
- Assessment of model performance on training, validation, and test datasets.  

**Included Activities:**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.  
- Handling imbalanced datasets and applying resampling techniques such as SMOTE.  
- Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.  
- Implementation and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes).  
- Statistical validation of techniques using T-tests and Permutation tests.  
- Cost estimation for implementing the Gaussian Naive Bayes model in a hospital setting.  
- Use of GitHub for collaborative development and version control.
